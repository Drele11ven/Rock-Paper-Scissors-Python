# Rock Paper Scissors Game with Algorithm Improvement

## This repository contains the code for a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented in Python. The game includes an algorithm that increases the chance of the program winning against human players over time.

### Getting Started
To play the game, simply run the Rps.py file. The game will prompt you to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and will display the computer's choice and the winner of the round. The game keeps track of the score and declares the winner after a set number of rounds.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
### Installation
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Drele11ven/rock-paper-scissors.git
```
- Change to the project directory:
```
cd rock-paper-scissors
```
- Run the Rps.py file:
```
python Rps.py
```
- Install requirements:
```
pip install -r req.txt
```
### Features
- User input validation to ensure a valid choice is entered
- A simple algorithm that increases the chance of the program winning over time
- Score tracking and display
- Display of the computer's choice and the winner of each round
### Usage
- Run the 'Rps.py; file.
- Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.
- The computer's choice and the winner of the round will be displayed.
- The score will be updated and displayed after each round.
- The game will end after a set number of rounds and declare the winner.
### Algorithm
- The algorithm used in this game increases the chance of the program winning over time by keeping track of the user's previous choices and adjusting the computer's choice accordingly. The algorithm is not foolproof, but it does increase the program's chances of winning.
